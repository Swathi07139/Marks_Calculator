# Marks_Calculator
Explanation:
Scanner for Input: We use Scanner to read input from the user.

Array for Marks: We store the marks of different subjects in an integer array.

Input Validation: We ensure that the user inputs valid integers and that marks are between 0 and 100.

Average Calculation: We compute the average of the marks.

Grade Determination: Based on the average, we assign a grade.

Results Display: The program prints the total marks, average, and the corresponding grade.

Running the Code:
Compile the Java file with javac MarksCalculator.java.
Run the compiled class with java MarksCalculator.
Make sure to handle exceptions and edge cases in a production environment, such as handling non-numeric input more gracefully and potentially extending the program to handle more subjects or different grading schemes.
